# We need to create a program that will help us to calculate 
# average exam score of a student. 
# We are given three variables as exam1, exam2 and exam3. 
# Calculate average score for a student. 
# 70 40 97 
# TO solve this question assign multiple variables in single line.


exam1, exam2, exam3 = 70, 40, 97
average_score = (exam1 + exam2 + exam3) / 3
print("Average score:", average_score)


exam1, exam2, exam3 = 70, 40, 97
avr_score = (exam1 + exam2 + exam3) / 3
print(avr_score)


#In the line below i am printing the avg score however there is 
#nothing the output that indicates that.
#the average score is 69
print ('the average exam score is,average_score', avr_score,average_score)
